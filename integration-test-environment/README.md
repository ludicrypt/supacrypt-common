# Supacrypt Integration Test Environment

## Overview

This directory contains the infrastructure and configuration for comprehensive end-to-end testing of the Supacrypt cryptographic suite across all supported platforms and providers.

## Location Notice

This integration test environment is located in `supacrypt-common/` as it provides cross-component testing capabilities for the entire Supacrypt suite.

## Architecture

The integration test environment consists of:

1. **Backend Service**: Supacrypt gRPC service with Azure Key Vault integration
2. **Provider Components**: PKCS#11, CSP, KSP, and CTK implementations
3. **Test Orchestration**: Cross-platform test execution framework
4. **Monitoring**: Performance and security monitoring during tests

## Test Environment Components

### Backend Service
- Azure Key Vault integration for cryptographic operations
- gRPC API endpoint for all provider communications
- Health monitoring and metrics collection
- TLS with client certificate authentication

### Platform-Specific Providers
- **Windows**: CSP and KSP providers for CAPI/CNG integration
- **macOS**: CTK provider for CryptoTokenKit integration  
- **Linux**: PKCS#11 provider for cross-platform compatibility

### Test Infrastructure
- Docker containers for reproducible environments
- Cross-platform test runners
- Performance monitoring tools
- Security validation scanners

## Current Implementation Status

Based on component review:

### Production Ready
- âœ… **Backend Service**: Complete gRPC implementation with Azure Key Vault
- âœ… **Docker/Kubernetes**: Production deployment configurations

### Well Advanced
- ðŸ”¶ **PKCS#11 Provider**: 75% complete, good test coverage
- ðŸ”¶ **CTK Provider**: 70% complete, basic functionality

### Moderate Implementation  
- ðŸ”¶ **CSP Provider**: 60% complete, needs crypto operations
- ðŸ”¶ **KSP Provider**: 65% complete, limited test coverage

## Test Categories

### 1. Component Integration Tests
- Backend service health and connectivity
- Provider-to-backend communication
- gRPC API validation
- Certificate authentication

### 2. Cross-Provider Compatibility Tests
- Key generation and sharing between providers
- Certificate operations across platforms
- Signature verification compatibility
- Encryption/decryption workflows

### 3. Performance Tests
- Operation latency measurement
- Throughput testing under load
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Scalability validation

### 4. Security Tests
- Authentication and authorization
- Certificate validation
- Error handling and information leakage
- Compliance validation

### 5. End-to-End Scenarios
- Multi-platform workflows
- Real-world application integration
- Failure recovery testing
- Monitoring and alerting

## Setup Instructions

See individual setup files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete environment setup
- `scripts/setup-*.sh` - Platform-specific configuration
- `configs/` - Test configuration files
- `tests/` - Test suites and scenarios

## Quality Gates

All tests must pass the following criteria:
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance within 5% overhead target
- 100% API compatibility across providers
- Complete error handling coverage
- Full operational monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Review the current implementation status
2. Set up the backend service environment
3. Configure platform-specific providers
4. Execute baseline functionality tests
5. Run integration test suites

See `scripts/quick-start.sh` for automated setup.
