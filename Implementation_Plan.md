# Supacrypt Implementation Plan

## Project Summary

Supacrypt is a comprehensive cryptographic software suite designed to provide cross-platform and native crypto providers that delegate operations to a centralized gRPC backend service. The project consists of six components across separate repositories, supporting RSA and ECC/ECDSA cryptographic operations through various platform-specific and cross-platform interfaces.
