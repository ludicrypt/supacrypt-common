## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Backend-as-a-Service Pattern
All cryptographic operations are centralized in the backend service, providing:
- Consistent cryptographic implementations
- Centralized key management
- Unified security policies
- Simplified maintenance and updates

### 2. Provider Abstraction Pattern
Platform-specific providers implement standard interfaces:
- PKCS#11 for cross-platform compatibility
- CSP/KSP for Windows native integration
- CTK for macOS native integration
- Common backend communication protocol

### 3. Microservices Architecture
The backend service follows microservices principles:
- Single responsibility (cryptographic operations)
- Independent deployment and scaling
- API-first design with gRPC
- Container-native deployment

### 4. Security-First Design
Security is integrated at every architectural level:
- mTLS for all communications
- Client certificate authentication
- Secure key storage with Azure Key Vault
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Input validation and sanitization

## Communication Architecture

### gRPC API Design
All components communicate through a well-defined gRPC API:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Provider as Crypto Provider
    participant Backend as Supacrypt Backend
    participant AKV as Azure Key Vault
    
    App->>Provider: Crypto Operation Request
    Provider->>Backend: gRPC API Call
    Backend->>AKV: Key Vault Operation
    AKV-->>Backend: Operation Result
    Backend-->>Provider: gRPC Response
    Provider-->>App: Crypto Operation Result
```

### Authentication Flow
Client certificate authentication ensures secure communication:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as Crypto Provider
    participant Backend as Backend Service
    participant Cert as Certificate Store
    
    Provider->>Cert: Load Client Certificate
    Provider->>Backend: Establish TLS Connection
    Backend->>Provider: Request Client Certificate
    Provider->>Backend: Present Certificate
    Backend->>Backend: Validate Certificate
    Backend-->>Provider: Authentication Success
    Provider->>Backend: gRPC API Calls
```
