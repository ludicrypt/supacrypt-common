# Supacrypt Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive architectural documentation for the Supacrypt cryptographic suite. The documentation is organized into the following sections:

## Documentation Structure

### Core Architecture
- **[System Architecture](system-architecture.md)** - High-level system design and component relationships
- **[Component Architecture](component-architecture.md)** - Detailed architecture of each component
- **[Security Architecture](security-architecture.md)** - Security design and threat model
- **[Data Flow Architecture](data-flow-architecture.md)** - Data flow and communication patterns

### Integration Patterns
- **[Provider Integration](provider-integration.md)** - How cryptographic providers integrate with the backend
- **[Cross-Platform Integration](cross-platform-integration.md)** - Multi-platform deployment and compatibility
- **[API Integration](api-integration.md)** - gRPC API design and usage patterns

### Deployment Architecture
- **[Deployment Topologies](deployment-topologies.md)** - Supported deployment configurations
- **[Infrastructure Requirements](infrastructure-requirements.md)** - System requirements and dependencies
- **[Scalability Architecture](scalability-architecture.md)** - Scaling patterns and considerations

## Quick Navigation

### For Architects
- Start with [System Architecture](system-architecture.md) for the overall design
- Review [Security Architecture](security-architecture.md) for security considerations
- Check [Deployment Topologies](deployment-topologies.md) for deployment planning

### For Developers  
- Review [Component Architecture](component-architecture.md) for implementation details
- Study [Provider Integration](provider-integration.md) for integration patterns
- Reference [API Integration](api-integration.md) for API usage

### For Operations
- Focus on [Infrastructure Requirements](infrastructure-requirements.md) for setup
- Review [Deployment Topologies](deployment-topologies.md) for deployment options
- Check [Scalability Architecture](scalability-architecture.md) for scaling

## Implementation Status

Based on current component implementation status:

| Component | Architecture Status | Implementation Status |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Backend Service | ✅ Complete | 85% - Production Ready |
| PKCS#11 Provider | ✅ Complete | 75% - Beta Ready |
| CTK Provider | ✅ Complete | 70% - Beta Ready |  
| CSP Provider | ✅ Complete | 60% - Needs Work |
| KSP Provider | ✅ Complete | 65% - Needs Work |

## Architecture Principles

### Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each component is independently deployable and testable
2. **Security First**: Security considerations integrated into every architectural decision
3. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent functionality across Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Standards Compliance**: Full compliance with PKCS#11, CSP, KSP, and CTK standards
5. **Performance**: Low-latency, high-throughput cryptographic operations
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing

### Architectural Patterns
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Centralized cryptographic operations via gRPC
- **Provider Pattern**: Platform-specific implementations with common interfaces
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilient communication between components
- **Observability Pattern**: Metrics, tracing, and logging throughout the system

## Getting Started

1. **Understand the System**: Start with [System Architecture](system-architecture.md)
2. **Review Security**: Read [Security Architecture](security-architecture.md) 
3. **Plan Deployment**: Check [Deployment Topologies](deployment-topologies.md)
4. **Implementation Details**: Review component-specific architecture documents

## Contribution Guidelines

When updating architecture documentation:
1. Maintain consistency with actual implementation
2. Update diagrams using Mermaid format
3. Include security considerations for all changes
4. Update cross-references between documents
5. Validate changes against current component status
