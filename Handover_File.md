# APM Handover File - Supacrypt Project - 2025-01-06

## Section 1: Handover Overview

*   **Outgoing Agent ID:** Manager_Instance_1
*   **Incoming Agent ID:** Manager_Instance_2
*   **Reason for Handover:** User initiated handover request
*   **Memory Bank Configuration:**
    *   **Location(s):** `./Memory/`
    *   **Structure:** Multi-file directory per phase
*   **Brief Project Status Summary:** Project successfully initialized with complete Implementation Plan and Memory Bank structure. Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation starting with protobuf design.

## Section 2: Project Goal & Current Objectives

The Supacrypt project aims to build a comprehensive cryptographic software suite providing cross-platform and native crypto providers that delegate operations to a centralized gRPC backend service. The suite consists of six components across separate repositories:

- **supacrypt-common**: Common components including protobuf definitions and shared libraries
- **supacrypt-backend-akv**: gRPC backend service using Azure Key Vault for crypto operations
- **supacrypt-pkcs11**: Cross-platform PKCS#11 provider
- **supacrypt-csp**: Windows CAPI CSP implementation
- **supacrypt-ksp**: Windows CNG KSP implementation
- **supacrypt-ctk**: macOS CryptoTokenKit implementation

Current immediate objective: Begin Phase 1 by designing and implementing the shared protobuf definition that will serve as the interface between all crypto providers and the backend service.

## Section 3: Implementation Plan Status

*   **Link to Main Plan:** `./Implementation_Plan.md`
*   **Current Phase/Focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Not yet started)
*   **Completed Tasks:** 
    *   Project discovery and requirements gathering - Status: Completed
    *   Implementation Plan creation - Status: Completed
    *   Memory Bank structure initialization - Status: Completed
*   **Tasks In Progress:**
    *   None currently in progress
*   **Upcoming Tasks (immediate next):**
    *   Task 1.1: Design and Implement Shared Protobuf Definition - **Intended Agent(s):** Implementation Agent - Protobuf Specialist
    *   Task 1.2: Establish Project-Wide Standards and Conventions - **Intended Agent(s):** Implementation Agent - Standards Architect
    *   Task 1.3: Initialize Repository Structures - **Intended Agent(s):** Implementation Agent - DevOps Specialist
*   **Deviations/Changes from Plan:** None

## Section 4: Key Decisions & Rationale Log

*   **Decision:** Use multi-file Memory Bank directory structure - **Rationale:** Project complexity with 5 phases, 6 repositories, multiple technology stacks warrants organized separation - **Approved By:** Manager - **Date:** 2025-01-06
*   **Decision:** Use mTLS for all communication between providers and backend - **Rationale:** Strong security requirement with no fallback mechanisms needed - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-06
*   **Decision:** Target 100% unit test coverage across all components - **Rationale:** High quality and reliability requirements for cryptographic software - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-06
*   **Decision:** Implement protobuf first before any component - **Rationale:** All components depend on shared interface definition - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-06

## Section 5: Active Agent Roster & Current Assignments

*   **Manager Agent:** Manager_Instance_1 (outgoing)
*   **Implementation Agents:** None currently active (awaiting task assignments)

## Section 6: Recent Memory Bank Entries

No entries yet in Memory Bank as implementation has not begun. All task log files have been initialized with headers and are ready for use.

## Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives

Summary of key points from recent conversation:
*   User confirmed understanding and approval of the Implementation Plan structure
*   User requested immediate handover after Implementation Plan and Memory Bank creation
*   Key technical decisions confirmed:
    - Use unary gRPC calls with proper error handling
    - No local caching or fallback mechanisms in providers
    - Authentication via mTLS only
    - Support common RSA key sizes and ECC curves
    - No specific compliance requirements beyond security best practices
*   User opened Implementation_Plan.md in IDE, indicating readiness to proceed
*   Handover was initiated immediately after project setup completion

## Section 8: Critical Code Snippets / Configuration / Outputs

Project structure currently consists only of:
- APM framework files in `supacrypt-common/prompts/`
- `Implementation_Plan.md` with complete 5-phase plan
- Memory Bank directory structure with initialized log files
- LICENSE files in each component directory

No code implementation has begun yet.

## Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks

*   **No blockers currently identified**
*   **Potential considerations for incoming Manager:**
    - Protobuf design must accommodate all provider APIs (PKCS#11, CSP, KSP, CTK) and Azure Key Vault limitations
    - Need to ensure forward compatibility in protobuf design
    - Cross-platform build system complexity for C++ components

## Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions

*   The first task assignment prompt needs to be prepared for Task 1.1 (Protobuf Design)
*   User specified to create protobuf at `supacrypt-common/proto/supacrypt.proto`
*   Implementation order confirmed: Protobuf → Backend → PKCS#11 → CSP → KSP → CTK
