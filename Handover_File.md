## Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks

*   **No active blockers for Phase 3** - All tasks successfully completed
*   **Phase 4 Windows Implementation Considerations:**
    - Windows CSP implementation requires deep Windows crypto API expertise
    - CNG KSP implementation needs knowledge of modern Windows cryptography
    - Certificate management in Windows environments differs from cross-platform
    - Windows-specific testing infrastructure needed
    - Integration testing between multiple Windows providers and shared backend
*   **Future Integration Considerations:**
    - Multi-provider coordination (PKCS#11, CSP, KSP) with single backend
    - Performance optimization across different provider types
    - Consistent error handling and logging across all providers

## Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions

*   **Phase 4 initiation needed:** Begin Windows Native Providers implementation
*   **Task 4.1 preparation:** Create assignment prompt for Windows CSP Implementation
*   **Cross-provider coordination:** Consider architecture for multiple providers sharing backend
*   **Windows development environment:** Ensure access to Windows development tools and testing infrastructure
*   **No specific deployment targets specified:** Implementation should support standard Windows deployment methods
