## Section 1: Handover Overview

*   **Outgoing Agent ID:** Manager_Instance_3
*   **Incoming Agent ID:** Manager_Instance_4
*   **Reason for Handover:** User initiated handover request
*   **Memory Bank Configuration:**
    *   **Location(s):** `./Memory/`
    *   **Structure:** Multi-file directory per phase
*   **Brief Project Status Summary:** Phase 2 (Backend Service Implementation) nearing completion with 6 of 7 tasks successfully completed. Only Task 2.7 (Containerization) remains. All core functionality implemented and tested.

## Section 2: Project Goal & Current Objectives

The Supacrypt project aims to build a comprehensive cryptographic software suite providing cross-platform and native crypto providers that delegate operations to a centralized gRPC backend service. The suite consists of six components across separate repositories:

- **supacrypt-common**: Common components including protobuf definitions and shared libraries
- **supacrypt-backend-akv**: gRPC backend service using Azure Key Vault for crypto operations
- **supacrypt-pkcs11**: Cross-platform PKCS#11 provider
- **supacrypt-csp**: Windows CAPI CSP implementation
- **supacrypt-ksp**: Windows CNG KSP implementation
- **supacrypt-ctk**: macOS CryptoTokenKit implementation

Current immediate objective: Complete Phase 2 by implementing containerization (Task 2.7), then prepare for Phase 3 (PKCS#11 Provider Implementation).

## Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives

Summary of key points from recent conversation (2025-06-08):
*   User progressively confirmed completion of Tasks 2.2 through 2.6
*   Manager Instance 3 prepared task assignment prompts for all remaining Phase 2 tasks
*   Key implementation achievements:
    - Backend service fully functional with Azure Key Vault integration
    - mTLS security implemented with authorization policies
    - Comprehensive observability with OpenTelemetry
    - Test suite with 85%+ coverage and performance benchmarks

*   User requested handover protocol after Task 2.6 completion
*   All Phase 2 infrastructure ready for containerization (Task 2.7)

## Section 8: Critical Code Snippets / Configuration / Outputs

Key service configuration from recent implementations:
```csharp
// Program.cs - mTLS and observability integration
builder.Services.AddSupacryptSecurity(builder.Configuration);
builder.Services.AddSupacryptObservability(builder.Configuration, builder.Environment);
builder.Services.AddSupacryptGrpc();
builder.Services.AddSupacryptServices();
builder.Services.AddSupacryptAzureKeyVaultConfiguration(builder.Configuration);

// SupacryptGrpcService.cs - Authorized with observability
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireValidCertificate")]
public class SupacryptGrpcService : SupacryptService.SupacryptServiceBase
{
    // Full implementation with metrics and tracing
}
```

Enhanced protobuf with Azure-specific error codes:
```protobuf
enum ErrorCode {
  // ... existing codes ...
  ERROR_CODE_AZURE_KV_ERROR = 18;        // Azure Key Vault specific errors
  
  // Azure Key Vault specific error codes (Task 2.3)
  ERROR_CODE_RATE_LIMITED = 1001;        // Azure Key Vault rate limiting
  ERROR_CODE_UNAUTHORIZED = 1002;        // Azure Key Vault unauthorized access
  ERROR_CODE_TIMEOUT = 1005;             // Operation timeout
  ERROR_CODE_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE = 1006; // Azure Key Vault service unavailable
}
```

## Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks

*   **No active blockers**
*   **Containerization considerations (Task 2.7):**
    - Need to ensure minimal container image size while including all dependencies
    - Certificate management in containerized environments needs careful planning
    - Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64) may have different optimization needs
*   **Upcoming Phase 3 considerations:**
    - PKCS#11 implementation will require extensive C++ expertise
    - Cross-platform compatibility testing infrastructure needed
    - Integration testing between PKCS#11 provider and backend service

## Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions

*   **Immediate action needed:** Assign Task 2.7 (Containerization) to DevOps Specialist
*   **Task 2.7 prompt ready:** `supacrypt-common/Task_2_7_Assignment_Prompt.md` prepared and awaiting assignment
*   **CLAUDE.md update consideration:** File shows outdated project state, may need updating after Phase 2 completion
*   **Phase 3 preparation:** After Task 2.7, need to transition to PKCS#11 provider implementation
*   **No specific container registry specified:** Implementation should support multiple registries (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Azure Container Registry)
