*   **Brief Project Status Summary:** Phase 1 (Foundation & Core Infrastructure) successfully completed with protobuf definition, standards documentation, and repository structures initialized. Ready to begin Phase 2 (Backend Service Implementation).

## Section 2: Project Goal & Current Objectives

The Supacrypt project aims to build a comprehensive cryptographic software suite providing cross-platform and native crypto providers that delegate operations to a centralized gRPC backend service. The suite consists of six components across separate repositories:

- **supacrypt-common**: Common components including protobuf definitions and shared libraries
- **supacrypt-backend-akv**: gRPC backend service using Azure Key Vault for crypto operations
- **supacrypt-pkcs11**: Cross-platform PKCS#11 provider
- **supacrypt-csp**: Windows CAPI CSP implementation
- **supacrypt-ksp**: Windows CNG KSP implementation
- **supacrypt-ctk**: macOS CryptoTokenKit implementation

Current immediate objective: Begin Phase 2 by implementing the .NET Aspire backend service that will serve as the central cryptographic operations hub.
