# Task Assignment: Phase 5 / Task 5.1 - macOS CTK Implementation

## Agent Role Assignment

You are assigned as **Implementation Agent - macOS Developer** for the Supacrypt project.

Your specialist capabilities include:
- Deep expertise in macOS development with Swift
- Strong understanding of CryptoTokenKit (CTK) framework
- Experience with macOS Security framework and Keychain Services
- Proficiency in gRPC client implementation for Apple platforms
- Knowledge of Universal Binary creation and code signing
- Understanding of macOS entitlements and sandboxing

## Task Overview

**Task ID:** Phase 5 / Task 5.1  
**Task Title:** Implement CTK Provider (supacrypt-ctk)  
**Estimated Effort:** High complexity - Core macOS native implementation

**Objective:** Create a macOS CryptoTokenKit implementation that integrates with the Supacrypt gRPC backend service, providing native cryptographic operations for macOS applications.

## Context and Background

The Supacrypt project has successfully completed:
- Phase 1: Foundation (protobuf design, standards, repository setup)
- Phase 2: Backend Service (fully functional gRPC backend with Azure Key Vault)
- Phase 3: PKCS#11 Provider (cross-platform implementation)
- Phase 4: Windows Native Providers (CSP and KSP implementations)

You are beginning Phase 5, focusing on macOS native support. The Windows providers achieved exceptional results (100% test coverage, 2.8% performance overhead) and serve as a quality benchmark.

### Key Technical Requirements
- **Target Platform:** macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma and later)
- **Implementation Language:** Modern Swift (Swift 5.9+)
- **Architecture:** Universal Binary (Apple Silicon + Intel)
- **Integration:** gRPC backend communication using Swift gRPC
- **Security:** Full CTK compliance with proper entitlements

## Detailed Sub-tasks

### 1. Set up Xcode Project Structure
- Create new Xcode project for macOS System Extension
- Configure as CryptoTokenKit extension with proper bundle identifiers
- Set minimum deployment target to macOS 14.0
- Configure Universal Binary build settings
- Set up Swift Package Manager for dependencies (gRPC-Swift, SwiftProtobuf)
- Configure proper code signing and entitlements

### 2. Implement TKTokenDriver Subclass
- Create main driver class inheriting from TKTokenDriver
- Implement token detection and initialization
- Configure supported token types and attributes
- Handle driver lifecycle (init, deinit)
- Implement configuration management
- Add proper logging using os_log

### 3. Create TKToken and TKTokenSession
- Implement TKToken subclass for token representation
- Create TKTokenSession for operation handling
- Implement session authentication mechanisms
- Handle token state management
- Support multiple simultaneous sessions
- Implement proper error propagation

### 4. Implement Key Operations
- **Key Generation:**
  - RSA (2048, 3072, 4096 bits)
  - ECC (P-256, P-384, P-521)
- **Cryptographic Operations:**
  - Sign/Verify operations
  - Encrypt/Decrypt (where applicable)
  - Key agreement (ECDH)
- **Key Management:**
  - List keys with metadata
  - Delete key support
  - Key attribute management

### 5. Integrate with gRPC Backend
- Implement gRPC client using Swift gRPC
- Create connection management with retry logic
- Implement request/response mapping
- Handle mTLS authentication
- Add connection pooling for performance
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Create error mapping from gRPC to CTK errors

### 6. Handle Keychain Integration
- Implement Keychain references for keys
- Support persistent key references
- Handle access control and permissions
- Integrate with Keychain access groups
- Support key sharing between applications

### 7. Support Universal Binary
- Ensure all dependencies support both architectures
- Test on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- Optimize for architecture-specific features
- Validate binary universal compatibility

## Technical Specifications

### CTK Framework Requirements
- Conform to all required CTK protocols
- Support smartcard emulation mode
- Handle all mandatory token operations
- Implement proper session management
- Support concurrent operations

### Swift Implementation Guidelines
- Use Swift 5.9+ features appropriately
- Follow Swift API design guidelines
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling with Swift Error
- Use property wrappers where beneficial
- Leverage Swift concurrency for thread safety

### Security Requirements
- Implement certificate pinning for gRPC connection
- Use os_log for security event logging
- Handle sensitive data with proper memory management
- Implement rate limiting for operations
- Support audit logging for all operations

### Performance Targets
- Token initialization: < 200ms
- RSA-2048 signing: < 150ms (including backend roundtrip)
- Key enumeration: < 100ms for 100 keys
- Memory footprint: < 50MB under normal operation

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components
- Use protobuf definitions from `supacrypt-common/proto/supacrypt.proto`
- Follow error handling patterns from Windows providers
- Maintain consistency with PKCS#11 provider behavior
- Use similar gRPC patterns as other providers

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- Handle macOS-specific error codes
- Support macOS authorization services
- Integrate with macOS audit system
- Support TouchID/FaceID when applicable

## Deliverables

1. **Complete CTK Provider Implementation:**

   - Proper Xcode project configuration
   - Swift Package manifest for dependencies

2. **Build Configuration:**
   - Universal Binary support
   - Debug and Release configurations
   - Proper entitlements files
   - Code signing setup

3. **Documentation:**
   - API documentation using Swift DocC
   - Integration guide for macOS applications
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

4. **Installation Components:**
