# Task 3.3: gRPC Integration for Cryptographic Operations Log

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: 3.3
**Task Name**: Complete gRPC Integration for Cryptographic Operations
**Description**: Complete the gRPC integration by generating protobuf stubs and implementing all cryptographic operations that communicate with the supacrypt-backend-akv service
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Assigned To**: Implementation Agent - Integration Developer
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-08

## Context
Build upon the existing gRPC infrastructure from Task 3.2 to deliver fully functional PKCS#11 cryptographic operations. All crypto operations delegate to the backend service through gRPC, with proper error handling, resilience patterns, and comprehensive integration.

## Requirements
- Generate protobuf stubs and integrate into build system
- Update GrpcConnectionPool to use generated stubs
- Implement C_GenerateKeyPair with full backend integration
- Implement signing operations (C_SignInit, C_Sign, C_SignUpdate, C_SignFinal)
- Implement verification operations (C_VerifyInit, C_Verify)
- Enhanced error mapping with detailed backend error responses
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Protobuf Generation**: Automated in CMake for seamless builds
2. **Connection Pool**: Simplified borrowing system for thread safety
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Fail-fast pattern to prevent cascade failures
4. **Error Mapping**: Two-tier approach (detailed + fallback) for robustness

### Key Algorithms Supported
- **RSA**: 2048, 3072, 4096-bit key generation and operations
- **ECC**: NIST P-256, P-384 curves for signing/verification
- **Mechanisms**: RSA-PKCS#1, RSA-PSS, ECDSA with SHA-256

### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for RPC efficiency
- Circuit breaker prevents resource waste on failed backend
- Minimal memory allocations in hot paths
- Proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management

### Security Features
- All cryptographic operations delegated to secure backend
- No private key material stored locally
- Secure gRPC channels with mutual TLS support
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
