## Implementation Notes

---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent - DevOps Specialist
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.3 / Initialize Repository Structures

**Summary:**
Successfully initialized directory structures, configuration files, documentation, and CI/CD templates for all six Supacrypt repositories according to technology-specific requirements.

**Details:**
- Created complete directory structures for all six repositories:
  - supacrypt-common: Added docs/architecture/, scripts/, shared/ directories
  - supacrypt-backend-akv: Established .NET project structure with src/, tests/, scripts/
  - supacrypt-pkcs11: Set up C++ structure with include/supacrypt/, src/, tests/, examples/, cmake/
  - supacrypt-csp: Created Windows C++ structure with include/, src/, tests/, installer/, tools/
  - supacrypt-ksp: Implemented identical Windows C++ structure to CSP
  - supacrypt-ctk: Established macOS structure with SupacryptCTK/, SupacryptCTKTests/, SupacryptCTKExtension/, scripts/
- Configured technology-specific .gitignore files for each repository with appropriate patterns
- Created .editorconfig files with consistent formatting rules and language-specific indentation
- Generated comprehensive README.md files describing each component's purpose, features, and requirements
- Verified existing MIT LICENSE files are properly formatted and consistent across all repositories
- Established GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline templates tailored to each technology stack

**Output/Result:**
```
Repository structures created:
- supacrypt-common: 4 new directories, .gitignore, .editorconfig, README.md, GitHub Actions workflow
- supacrypt-backend-akv: 4 new directories, .NET-specific .gitignore, .editorconfig, README.md, .NET CI workflow
- supacrypt-pkcs11: 5 new directories, C++-specific .gitignore, .editorconfig, README.md, cross-platform CI workflow
- supacrypt-csp: 5 new directories, Windows C++-specific .gitignore, .editorconfig, README.md, multi-platform CI workflow
- supacrypt-ksp: 5 new directories, Windows C++-specific .gitignore, .editorconfig, README.md, multi-platform CI workflow  
- supacrypt-ctk: 4 new directories, Xcode-specific .gitignore, .editorconfig, README.md, macOS-specific CI workflow

All repositories now have consistent organizational patterns with technology-appropriate tooling and configuration.
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps:**
Foundation is established for subsequent development phases. All repositories are ready for technology-specific implementation work as defined in Phase 2-5 tasks.
