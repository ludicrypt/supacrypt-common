# Memory Bank Log: Phase 1 / Task 1.2 / Establish Project-Wide Standards and Conventions

## Task Reference
**Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure  
**Task:** 1.2 - Establish Project-Wide Standards and Conventions  
**Agent Role:** Implementation Agent - Standards Architect  
**Completion Date:** 2025-01-07  

## Task Summary
Successfully created comprehensive standards documentation covering all technology stacks and cross-component requirements for the Supacrypt cryptographic software suite. Established unified conventions to ensure consistency across backend service, PKCS#11 provider, Windows CSP/KSP implementations, and macOS CTK provider.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. C++ Coding Standards (`docs/standards/cpp-coding-standards.md`)
- **Scope:** C++20/C17 standards for native cryptographic providers
- **Key Standards Established:**
  - Allman brace style for consistency across platforms
  - PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables
  - RAII memory management with smart pointers
  - Platform-specific conditional compilation patterns
  - Thread safety using std::mutex and std::shared_mutex
  - Error code ranges for each provider (PKCS#11: 2000-2999, CSP: 3000-3999, KSP: 4000-4999, CTK: 5000-5999)

### 2. C# Coding Standards (`docs/standards/csharp-coding-standards.md`)
- **Scope:** C# 13/.NET 9 standards for backend service
- **Key Standards Established:**
  - K&R brace style for .NET consistency
  - Microsoft naming guidelines compliance
  - Async/await patterns with ConfigureAwait(false)
  - Dependency injection using .NET Aspire 9.3 patterns
  - Structured logging with Serilog integration
  - gRPC service implementation conventions

### 3. Naming Conventions (`docs/standards/naming-conventions.md`)
- **Scope:** Cross-component naming standards
- **Key Conventions Established:**
  - Environment variables: `SUPACRYPT_[COMPONENT]_[TYPE]_[PURPOSE]`
  - gRPC services following protobuf patterns (SupacryptService established)
  - OpenTelemetry metrics: `supacrypt.[component].[metric_type].[name]`
  - Error code ranges allocated per component
  - Provider-specific naming patterns for PKCS#11, CSP/KSP, and CTK

### 4. Error Handling Guide (`docs/standards/error-handling-guide.md`)
- **Scope:** Comprehensive error handling patterns and codes
- **Key Standards Established:**
  - Component error code ranges:
    - Backend service: 1000-1999
    - PKCS#11 provider: 2000-2999
    - Windows CSP: 3000-3999
    - Windows KSP: 4000-4999
    - macOS CTK: 5000-5999
  - gRPC status code mapping patterns
  - Error propagation and logging requirements
  - Correlation ID tracking for debugging

### 5. Logging Standards (`docs/standards/logging-standards.md`)
- **Scope:** Structured logging across all components
- **Key Standards Established:**
  - Log levels: Critical, Error, Warning, Information, Debug, Trace
  - Required fields: timestamp, component, operation, correlation_id
  - JSON structured logging format
  - Sensitive data handling guidelines (never log cryptographic keys)
  - Component-specific logging configuration for .NET and C++

### 6. Testing Standards (`docs/standards/testing-standards.md`)
- **Scope:** Testing approaches and requirements
- **Key Standards Established:**
  - Minimum 80% unit test coverage requirement
  - AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) for all tests
  - Test naming convention: `[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedBehavior]`
  - Integration testing patterns for cross-component validation
  - Performance benchmarking with BenchmarkDotNet
  - Security testing including cryptographic validation

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility Strategy
- **Decision:** Use conditional compilation for platform-specific code while maintaining common interfaces
- **Rationale:** Enables platform optimization while ensuring consistent API across all providers
- **Impact:** Each provider can leverage platform-specific features while maintaining interoperability

### 2. Error Code Range Allocation
- **Decision:** Allocated non-overlapping 1000-number ranges per component
- **Rationale:** Enables immediate identification of error source and prevents conflicts
- **Impact:** Simplifies debugging and error tracking across distributed components

### 3. Structured Logging Approach
- **Decision:** JSON-based structured logging with correlation ID tracking
- **Rationale:** Enables effective log aggregation, searching, and distributed tracing
- **Impact:** Supports observability requirements and simplifies troubleshooting

### 4. Technology Stack Alignment
- **Decision:** Align with established platform conventions while maintaining consistency
- **Rationale:** Balances developer familiarity with cross-platform consistency
- **Impact:** Reduces learning curve while ensuring predictable behavior

## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Platform-Specific Requirements vs Consistency
- **Challenge:** Balancing Windows-specific CSP/KSP patterns with cross-platform consistency
- **Solution:** Established platform-specific sections within unified standards documents
- **Outcome:** Maintains platform compliance while ensuring interoperability

### 2. Technology Stack Diversity
- **Challenge:** Creating unified standards across C++, C#, and platform-specific APIs
- **Solution:** Focused on behavior patterns and naming conventions rather than syntax
- **Outcome:** Achieved consistency in intent while respecting language idioms

### 3. Security vs Observability
- **Challenge:** Ensuring adequate logging without exposing sensitive cryptographic material
- **Solution:** Defined explicit guidelines for sensitive data handling with positive/negative examples
- **Outcome:** Clear security boundaries while maintaining debugging capabilities

## Implementation Impact

### For Development Teams
- Clear, actionable guidelines with concrete examples
- Consistent patterns across all technology stacks
- Reduced decision fatigue through established conventions
- Security-first approach baked into all standards

### For System Integration
- Unified error handling enabling effective debugging
- Consistent logging enabling distributed tracing
- Standardized naming supporting automation and tooling
- Clear testing patterns ensuring reliability

### For Future Maintenance
- Well-documented rationale for decisions
- Extensible patterns for new components
- Version-aware naming conventions
- Comprehensive coverage of all architectural aspects
