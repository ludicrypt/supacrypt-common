## Task Overview
**Task ID**: 1.1
**Task Name**: Protobuf Service Definition Design
**Description**: Design and implement protobuf service definitions for communication between components
**Status**: PENDING
**Assigned To**: [Not Assigned]
**Created**: 2025-01-06

**Agent:** Implementation Agent - Protobuf Specialist
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.1 / Design and Implement Shared Protobuf Definition

**Summary:**
Successfully designed and implemented comprehensive protobuf definition file (`supacrypt.proto`) containing all required message structures and gRPC service interface for cryptographic operations across all providers.

**Details:**
- Analyzed requirements from PKCS#11, Windows CSP/KSP, macOS CTK, and Azure Key Vault APIs
- Designed message structures supporting RSA (2048/3072/4096-bit) and ECC (P-256/P-384/P-521) operations
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with provider-specific error codes
- Created versioned package structure (`supacrypt.v1`) with extensibility features
- Used `oneof` fields for algorithm-specific parameters and reserved field numbers for future extensions
- Included comprehensive documentation comments for all messages and enums
- Designed unary RPC service methods: GenerateKey, SignData, VerifySignature, GetKey, ListKeys, DeleteKey
- Implemented signing parameters supporting various padding schemes (PKCS#1, PSS) and hash algorithms (SHA-256/384/512)
- Added proper timestamp handling using `google.protobuf.Timestamp`

**Output/Result:**
```
Created file: supacrypt-common/proto/supacrypt.proto
- 6 main service methods with proper request/response patterns
- 15+ message types covering all cryptographic operations
- 7 enums for algorithms, curves, hashing, padding, and error codes
- Comprehensive error handling with ErrorDetails message
- Version field in all requests for protocol evolution
- Reserved field numbers for future extensibility
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. Protobuf compiles successfully with `protoc --descriptor_set_out=/dev/null` validation.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Ready for backend service implementation (Task 2.2) and provider implementations (Tasks 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1).

**Agent:** Implementation Agent - Protobuf Specialist
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.1 / Design and Implement Shared Protobuf Definition (Encryption/Decryption Extension)

**Summary:**
Extended protobuf definition to include missing encryption and decryption operations, adding comprehensive support for RSA and ECC encryption/decryption operations.

**Details:**
- Added EncryptData and DecryptData service methods to SupacryptService
- Designed EncryptionParameters message with algorithm-specific parameters using oneof pattern
- Created RSAEncryptionParameters supporting PKCS#1 v1.5 and OAEP padding schemes with configurable hash algorithms
- Added ECCEncryptionParameters for ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) support
- Extended RSAPaddingScheme enum to include RSA_PADDING_OAEP for encryption operations
- Added new error codes for encryption/decryption failures (ERROR_CODE_ENCRYPTION_FAILED, ERROR_CODE_DECRYPTION_FAILED)
- Implemented complete request/response message pairs: EncryptDataRequest/Response, DecryptDataRequest/Response
- Added support for OAEP parameters including hash algorithm and optional label
- Included KDF parameters for ECC encryption operations

**Output/Result:**
```
Extended supacrypt.proto with:
- 2 additional service methods (EncryptData, DecryptData)
- 6 new message types for encryption/decryption operations
- Enhanced RSAPaddingScheme enum with OAEP support
- 2 new error codes for crypto operation failures
- Complete parameter structures for both RSA and ECC encryption
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. Updated protobuf compiles successfully and maintains backward compatibility with existing definitions.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Protobuf definition now complete with all required cryptographic operations (generate, sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt, key management).
