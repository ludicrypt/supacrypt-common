# Task 2.2: Backend Core Implementation Log

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: 2.2
**Task Name**: Backend Core Implementation
**Description**: Implement core backend service with gRPC server and basic endpoints
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Assigned To**: Claude Code Implementation Agent
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-07

## Context
Implement the core backend service functionality including gRPC server setup, basic cryptographic operation endpoints, and foundational service architecture. This forms the heart of the Supacrypt backend.

## Requirements
- Implement gRPC server with protobuf definitions
- Create service interfaces for cryptographic operations
- Implement basic key management operations
- Set up dependency injection and service layers
- Implement error handling and logging

## Progress Log

### Entry 1 - Task Initialization
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Author**: Manager Agent
**Status Update**: Task created and ready for assignment
**Details**: 
- Task log file created in Memory Bank
- Awaiting assignment to implementation agent
- Prerequisites: Task 1.1 (Protobuf Design), Task 2.1 (Project Structure)

### Entry 2 - Build Error Remediation and Completion
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Author**: Claude Code Implementation Agent
**Status Update**: Task completed successfully with all build errors resolved
**Details**:
- Fixed critical enum naming mismatches between protobuf and C# code
- Added missing gRPC reflection package and registration
- Updated all service implementations to use correct generated enum names
- Resolved 67+ build errors related to enum references
- All validation tests passing successfully

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Issues Resolved
1. **Enum Naming Mismatch**: The protobuf generates proper C# naming conventions (e.g., `KeyAlgorithm.Rsa`) but the code was using non-standard naming (e.g., `KeyAlgorithmRsa`). Fixed all references across:
   - ErrorMapper.cs
   - MockCryptographicOperations.cs  
   - MockKeyManagementService.cs
   - All validation files

2. **Missing gRPC Reflection Package**: Added `Grpc.AspNetCore.Server.Reflection` package reference to enable gRPC reflection in development environment.

3. **Build System Issues**: Resolved protobuf code generation issues and package reference problems.

### Key Files Updated
- `Directory.Packages.props`: Added gRPC reflection package
- `Supacrypt.Backend.csproj`: Added package reference
- Multiple service and validation files: Fixed enum references
- All mock implementations: Updated to use correct enum values

### Validation Results
- ✅ Solution builds without errors (`dotnet build` succeeds)
- ✅ All unit tests pass (`dotnet test` succeeds)  
- ✅ Service starts successfully and listens on configured port (HTTP/2)
- ✅ gRPC reflection registered and available in development mode
- ✅ Health checks configured correctly for gRPC service

## Next Steps for Task 2.3
With Task 2.2 completed successfully, the following considerations are ready for Task 2.3 (Azure Key Vault Integration):
- All mock implementations are working and can be replaced with Azure Key Vault implementations
- Service interfaces are stable and ready for real cryptographic operations
- Error handling framework is in place for Azure-specific errors
- Configuration system is ready for Azure Key Vault connection strings
- Health checks framework ready for Azure Key Vault connectivity checks
