## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Overview
The macOS CTK implementation follows a modular architecture:

```

│   ├── SupacryptTokenDriver   # Main driver class
│   ├── SupacryptToken         # Token representation
│   ├── SupacryptTokenSession  # Session management

    └── supacrypt.grpc.swift   # gRPC service client
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Swift Implementation**: Used modern Swift 5.9+ with async/await for better performance and maintainability
2. **Universal Binary**: Supports both Apple Silicon and Intel architectures natively
3. **Security Framework Integration**: Leverages macOS Security framework for actual cryptographic operations
4. **Keychain Integration**: Uses system keychain for secure key storage with proper access controls
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error mapping between gRPC, Security framework, and CTK errors

### Security Considerations
- Code signing with proper entitlements for system extension
- Sandboxing compliance with minimal required permissions
- Secure memory handling for cryptographic material
- Certificate pinning for gRPC connections
- Audit logging for all cryptographic operations

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling for gRPC backend communication
- Efficient keychain queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading of key objects and metadata
- Async operations to prevent UI blocking
- Memory-efficient data structures

### Integration Points
- **CryptoTokenKit**: Native macOS token framework integration
- **Security Framework**: System cryptographic operations
- **Keychain Services**: Secure key storage and retrieval
- **gRPC**: Backend communication protocol
- **System Extensions**: macOS system-level integration

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests with mock gRPC backend
- Platform tests on both Apple Silicon and Intel
- Security validation and penetration testing
- Performance benchmarking against targets
